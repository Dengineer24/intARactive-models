# intARactive-models

## 💡 Inspiration:

Our project strives to discover possible solutions to the question in the Education track: What can technology facilitate in helping parents in homeschooling their children?

 Students require hands-on and visual experiments, yet students that 
 take remote classes or home-schooled students face difficulties in 
 understanding concepts because they do not have access to hands 
 on learning materials at home. And that's were our project, 
 IntARactive models, can help!

## 💻 What it does:

IntARactive models is a web app where Mechanical Engineering 
Students can come along and learn with a more hands-on experience 
through the use of 3D models and AR. There is also a chatroom function 
created with Twilio which allows students to find peer students with 
similar interests and ask questions and collaborate.

## 🔨 How we built it:

  #### Front-end:
       - React JS
       - Typescript
       - CSS/SCSS
       - React-Three-Fiber
       - ThreeJs: For rendering 3d models 
       - HTML

 #### Back-end: 
      - Node JS
      - JavaScript
      - Express 
      - Twilio API

## Most Creative Use of Twilio:

 Twilio provides a ton of other awesome communication features using 
 web service APIs. We have used to Twilio to create the chatroom, which 
 provides a great platform for the students to collaborate.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into:

 BackEnd-Implementing the back-end connection for the Twillio API into the React 
 based website.
 FrontEnd-npm version and scss conflict, first time working on loading and gear animation 
 Online Hackathon-Coding with teammates and mentors in different time zones

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of:

 - Learned an incredible amount in the time limit
 - Completed the project in the given time-frame

## 📖 What we learned:

 - How to use Twilio API
 - Working with Three.js 
 - Learn Typescript
